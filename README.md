\`\`\`

### Directory Breakdown:

*   **`app/`**: This directory leverages Next.js's App Router for routing and rendering.
    *   `layout.tsx`: Defines the shared UI for all routes. It sets up the HTML structure, imports necessary fonts (Inter for English, Cairo and Noto Sans Arabic for Arabic), and wraps the application with the `LanguageProvider` to enable global language state management.
    *   `page.tsx`: Contains the core content of the landing page. It's a client component that uses the `useLanguage` hook to dynamically render text based on the selected locale, ensuring a seamless bilingual experience. All sections (Hero, Features, Packages, Why AI, FAQ, Payment Methods) are defined here.
    *   `globals.css`: This file imports Tailwind CSS base styles, components, and utilities. It also defines custom CSS variables for colors and font families, ensuring consistent styling across the application.
*   **`components/`**: This directory houses reusable React components that are specific to this application.
    *   `videofy-logo.tsx`: A simple, presentational component responsible for rendering the Videofy logo image and its name.
    *   `language-switcher.tsx`: An interactive dropdown component that allows users to toggle between English and Arabic. It utilizes `shadcn/ui`'s `DropdownMenu` and interacts with the `LanguageContext` to update the application's language.
    *   `ui/`: This sub-directory contains UI components generated by `shadcn/ui`. These components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Accordion`, `DropdownMenu`) are pre-built, accessible, and styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a consistent and high-quality user interface.
*   **`lib/`**: This directory is for utility functions, helper modules, and configuration files that are not directly React components.
    *   `i18n.ts`: A crucial file for internationalization. It stores all the translated text content for the entire landing page in both English (`en`) and Arabic (`ar`). It exports a `translations` object and a `getTranslation` function, making it easy to retrieve localized strings.
    *   `language-context.tsx`: Implements a React Context and Provider pattern to manage the global language state (`locale`). This allows any component within the application to access the current language and trigger language changes, and it also dynamically sets the `dir` attribute on the `<html>` element for proper Right-to-Left (RTL) or Left-to-Right (LTR) text direction.
*   **`public/`**: This directory is for static assets that are served directly by Next.js.
    *   `videofy-logo.png`: The image file for the Videofy logo, used in the `VideofyLogo` component.
    *   `favicon.ico`: The small icon displayed in the browser tab or bookmarks.
*   **`next.config.mjs`**: The Next.js configuration file. It's set up to handle image optimization for external URLs (like `blob.v0.dev` for the logo) and ignores ESLint/TypeScript errors during build for quicker development iterations.
*   **`tailwind.config.ts`**: The configuration file for Tailwind CSS. It extends the default Tailwind theme with custom colors (e.g., `navy`, `orangeCTA`, `skyBlue`) as specified in the project requirements, ensuring brand consistency.
*   **`package.json`**: Defines the project's metadata (name, version), scripts for development and build processes (`dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`), and lists all required npm dependencies (e.g., `next`, `react`, `tailwindcss`, `lucide-react`, `shadcn/ui` related packages).
*   **`tsconfig.json`**: The TypeScript configuration file. It ensures proper type checking, compilation settings, and path aliases (`@/*`) for the project, contributing to code quality and maintainability.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository (if applicable)

If you received this project as a downloaded archive, extract its contents to your desired directory.

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal and install all the necessary Node.js packages:

\`\`\`bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
\`\`\`

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the Next.js development server. This will compile the project and make it accessible locally:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
\`\`\`

### 4. Open in Browser

Once the development server is running, open your web browser and navigate to:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You should now see the Videofy landing page.

## Development Guidelines

To ensure smooth future development and maintain code quality:

*   **Styling**: Always use Tailwind CSS classes for styling. For complex UI elements, prefer using or extending `shadcn/ui` components. Define custom colors and themes in `tailwind.config.ts`.
*   **Internationalization**: All user-facing text should be managed through `lib/i18n.ts`. When adding new text, ensure it's provided in both English and Arabic. Use the `useLanguage` hook to access translated strings in your components.
*   **Component Reusability**: Break down complex sections into smaller, focused, and reusable React components. Place them in the `components/` directory.
*   **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for all new code. Define clear interfaces and types to ensure data consistency and reduce runtime errors.
*   **Environment Variables**: For any sensitive information or configurable values (e.g., API keys, external service URLs) that might be added in future features, use Next.js's environment variables. Create a `.env.local` file (which is git-ignored) and access variables using `process.env.YOUR_VARIABLE_NAME`. Remember to prefix client-side variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
*   **Accessibility**: Always consider accessibility (a11y) when developing. Use semantic HTML, provide `alt` text for images, and ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

## Customization

*   **Content**: All textual content can be easily modified in `lib/i18n.ts`.
*   **WhatsApp Number**: Update the `whatsappNumber` in `lib/i18n.ts` with your actual WhatsApp contact number.
*   **USDT TRC20 Address**: Replace the `TRC20_WALLET_ADDRESS_HERE` placeholder in `lib/i18n.ts` with your actual USDT TRC20 wallet address.
*   **Colors**: Adjust the custom color definitions in `tailwind.config.ts` to match any future branding changes.
*   **Sections**: Add, remove, or reorder sections in `app/page.tsx` as needed.

## Deployment

This project is built with Next.js and is highly optimized for deployment on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), the creators of Next.js. You can deploy it directly from your Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) with zero configuration.
